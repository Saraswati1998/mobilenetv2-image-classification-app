ðŸŒ¸ Flower Image Classifier with Streamlit
Overview
This repository contains a Flower Image Classifier built using Streamlit, TensorFlow, and Keras. The app utilizes a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, which has been fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 104 different flower species. This classifier allows users to upload images of flowers and receive predictions about their species in real-time. The application offers an interactive and easy-to-use web interface for flower classification tasks, making it suitable for both beginners and professionals working with machine learning models in a real-time setting.

Features
Streamlit Interface: Provides a simple, interactive, and user-friendly web interface for uploading flower images and displaying predictions.

MobileNetV2 Model: Uses the lightweight and efficient MobileNetV2 architecture, which is optimized for mobile and edge devices. The model is fine-tuned with a custom flower species dataset to enhance classification accuracy.

Data Augmentation: To improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting, the data is augmented using TensorFlowâ€™s tf.data API. This includes techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and zooming.

Real-Time Prediction: As soon as a user uploads a flower image, the app processes it and displays the predicted flower species along with a confidence score, providing instant results.

Model Deployment: The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the app on their local machine or deploy it to the cloud for broader access.

How It Works
User Uploads an Image: The user uploads a flower image through the Streamlit interface.

Model Prediction: The app processes the uploaded image and runs it through the MobileNetV2 model, which predicts the flower species.

Results Displayed: The prediction results are displayed, along with a confidence score, providing the user with information about the species of the uploaded flower.

Model Details
Architecture: MobileNetV2, a convolutional neural network designed for efficient mobile and edge device use.

Transfer Learning: The model uses transfer learning, where a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 104 flower species for improved accuracy.

Dataset: The dataset used contains images of 104 flower species, with varied image sizes and conditions, to ensure robust performance across different types of flower images.
